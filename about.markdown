The [Designing Future Wheat project](https://designingfuturewheat.org.uk/) is a BBSRC funded Designing Future Wheat Institute Strategic Programme (ISP), that spans eight research institutes and universities and aims to develop new wheat germplasm containing the next generation of key traits. Read more about the DFW programme at: [www.designingfuturewheat.org.uk](https://designingfuturewheat.org.uk/about/).

The [Work Package 3](https://designingfuturewheat.org.uk/work-package-3/) component of the project aims to accelerate the discovery and deployment of genes and alleles of high value for breeding. Through this part of the project NIAB has created large, statistically powerful and diverse genetic resources formed using Synthetic Hexaploid Wheat (SHW) and direct crosses between hexaploid wheat and a wide range of tetraploid landraces and wild progenitors. More details on WP3 can be found [here](https://designingfuturewheat.org.uk/work-package-3/).

The current NIAB DFW WP3 team consists of:

- Bethany Love
- Fiona Leigh
- Phil Howell
- Richard Horsnell
- Robert Jackson
- Sigrid Heuer
- Tally Wright
