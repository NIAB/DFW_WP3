The [Designing Future Wheat project](https://designingfuturewheat.org.uk/) is a BBSRC funded Designing Future Wheat Institute Strategic Programme (ISP), that spans eight research institutes and universities and aims to develop new wheat germplasm containing the next generation of key traits.

The [Work Package 3](https://designingfuturewheat.org.uk/work-package-3/) component of the project aims to accelerate the discovery and deployment of genes and alleles of high value for breeding. Through this part of the project NIAB has created large, statistically powerful and diverse genetic resources formed using Synthetic Hexaploid Wheat (SHW) and direct crosses with a wild range of tetraploids. 

The current NIAB DFW WP3 team consists of:

- Bethany Love
- Fiona Leigh
- Phil Howell
- Richard Horsnell
- Robert Jackson
- Sigrid Heuer
- Tally Wright
